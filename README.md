## Description
My class had a channel on a Discord server that published the agenda of the week manually. I had the idea of creating a script that sends a webhook with the screenshot of the website that sends a screenshot of the agenda with a Discord webhook automatically with the use of a simple script.

## Screenshot

Too lazy to do it.

## Requirements for running the script

- Python 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11  
- Discord Webhook URL
- Student ID (obtainable via the URL when you're logged in)

## How to use it?

- [Create a Discord Webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
- Modify the script to use your Webhook URL
- Launch the script (launch.sh or launch.bat)
- Magic.
